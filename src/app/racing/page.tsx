                beginning in May, we will be running through some of the basics
                of crewing on a racing boat and we hope that many of you will
                join us.

                Thatâ€™s how most sailors get started racing: you crew on
                someoneâ€™s boat and then you get the confidence to take your own
                boat out. Once the race is done, everyone gathers for a
                post-race debrief which consists of friendly banter and
                beverages. If you are interested and would like more
                information, please contact our{" "}
